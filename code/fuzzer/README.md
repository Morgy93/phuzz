Fuzzer Component
====================

This is the core component of PHUZZ.

## Fuzzer

The `fuzzer.py` performs most of the work. It first loads the configuration files, parses it and generates a set of initial candidates. Then these are send to the target application and the response is then passed to the VulnCheckers to identify potential vulnerabilities. 

Afterwards, the candidate is rated using the ScoringFormula. The highest ranking ('best') candidate is mutated N times and each new candidate is send to the target application, and the cycle repeats.

Since PHUZZ supports parallel fuzzing, the candidates generated by other instances are synchronized.

## Candidate

A candidate is an instance of the `Candidate` class that holds the information required to generate the HTTP request to the target and the resulting vulnerability information and score.

## Mutator

A `Mutator` is a class implementing a set of `ParamMutators` that will take a candidate's parameter and apply changes to it to generate new values that could lead to vulnerabilities or new coverage in the target application.

## Scoring

Here, scoring formulas to rate candidates can be implemented. For now, PHUZZ only supports basic scoring formulas.

## VulnCheck

The `VulnChecker` classes implement a call to a set of different `VulnChecks` that are used to identify client-side and server-side vulnerabilities in the target application, e.g. by checking the instrumentation's output for a specific candidate.
