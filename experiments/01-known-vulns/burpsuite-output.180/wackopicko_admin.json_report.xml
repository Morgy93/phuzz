    <issueBackground><![CDATA[<p>RFC 1918 specifies ranges of IP addresses that are reserved for use in private networks and cannot be routed on the public Internet. Although various methods exist by which an attacker can determine the public IP addresses in use by an organization, the private addresses used internally cannot usually be determined in the same ways.</p>
<p>Discovering the private addresses used within an organization can help an attacker in carrying out network-layer attacks aiming to penetrate the organization's internal infrastructure. </p>]]></issueBackground>
    <remediationBackground><![CDATA[<p>There is not usually any good reason to disclose the internal IP addresses used within an organization's infrastructure. If these are being returned in service banners or debug messages, then the relevant services should be configured to mask the private addresses. If they are being used to track back-end servers for load balancing purposes, then the addresses should be rewritten with innocuous identifiers from which an attacker cannot infer any useful information about the infrastructure.</p>]]></remediationBackground>

    <issueBackground><![CDATA[<p>Out-of-band resource load arises when it is possible to induce an application to fetch content from an arbitrary external location, and incorporate that content into the application's own response(s). The ability to trigger arbitrary out-of-band resource load does not constitute a vulnerability in its own right, and in some cases might even be the intended behavior of the application. 
However, in many cases, it can indicate a vulnerability with serious consequences.</p>
<p>The ability to request and retrieve web content from other systems can allow the application server to be used as a two-way attack proxy. 
  By submitting suitable payloads, an attacker can cause the application server to attack, or retrieve content from, other systems that it can interact with. 
  This may include public third-party systems, internal systems within the same organization, or services available on the local loopback adapter of the application server itself. 
  Depending on the network architecture, this may expose highly vulnerable internal services that are not otherwise accessible to external attackers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the application's processing of web content that is retrieved from arbitrary URLs exposes some important and non-conventional attack surface. 
  An attacker can deploy a web server that returns malicious content, and then induce the application to retrieve and process that content. 
  This processing might give rise to the types of input-based vulnerabilities that are normally found when unexpected input is submitted directly in requests to the application. 
  The out-of-band attack surface that the application exposes should be thoroughly tested for these types of vulnerabilities. </p>]]></issueBackground>
    <remediationBackground><![CDATA[<p>You should review the purpose and intended use of the relevant application functionality, and determine whether the ability to trigger arbitrary out-of-band resource load is intended behavior. 
  If so, you should be aware of the types of attacks that can be performed via this behavior and take appropriate measures. 
  These measures might include blocking network access from the application server to other internal systems, and hardening the application server itself to remove any services available on the local loopback adapter. 
You should also ensure that content retrieved from other systems is processed in a safe manner, with the usual precautions that are applicable when processing input from direct incoming web requests.</p>
<p>If the ability to trigger arbitrary out-of-band resource load is not intended behavior, then you should implement a whitelist of permitted URLs, and block requests to URLs that do not appear on this whitelist.</p>]]></remediationBackground>

    <issueBackground><![CDATA[<p>The ability to induce an application to interact with an arbitrary external service, such as a web or mail server, does not constitute a vulnerability in its own right. This might even be the intended behavior of the application. However, in some cases, it can indicate a vulnerability with serious consequences.</p>
<p>If you can trigger DNS-based interactions, it is normally possible to trigger interactions using other service types. Burp Scanner reports these as separate issues. You may find that a payload, such as a URL, only triggers a DNS-based interaction, even though you were expecting interactions with a different service as well. This could be due to egress filters on the network layer that prevent the application from connecting to these other services. However, some systems perform DNS lookups without any intention of connecting to the remote host. This behavior is typically harmless.</p>
<p>The ability to send requests to other systems can allow the vulnerable server to be used as an attack proxy. By submitting suitable payloads, an attacker can cause the application server to attack other systems that it can interact with. This may include public third-party systems, internal systems within the same organization, or services available on the local loopback adapter of the application server itself. Depending on the network architecture, this may expose highly vulnerable internal services that are not otherwise accessible to external attackers.</p>]]></issueBackground>

<p>Out-of-Band Application Security Testing (OAST) is highly effective at uncovering high-risk features, to the point where finding the root cause of an interaction can be quite challenging. To find the source of an external service interaction, try to identify whether it is triggered by specific application functionality, or occurs indiscriminately on all requests. If it occurs on all endpoints, a front-end CDN or application firewall may be responsible, or a back-end analytics system parsing server logs. In some cases, interactions may originate from third-party systems; for example, a HTTP request may trigger a poisoned email which passes through a link-scanner on its way to the recipient.</p>]]></remediationBackground>
